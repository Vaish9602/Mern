// there are two phases of execution

// 1. creation phase

// functions are loaded in memory
// for variables space is reserved and default value is set to undefined

// 2. execution phase

// code is executed line by line


// Global exection context(there is only one)

// Memory(variable + function)
// code
// this

console.log(this)
// global level what is the value of this - window object in case of browser
// Node.js = global object

// scope chain

// a function remembers where it was lexically written, not where it was called

// inner scope -> outer scope -> global scope
